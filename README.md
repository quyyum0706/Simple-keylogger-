# Simple Keylogger in Python  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **basic keylogger** built using Python and the `pynput` library. It records keyboard inputs and logs them to a file for monitoring purposes.

This program is intended for educational purposes **ONLY**. Ensure you have permission before using it on any system.  


### 2️⃣ **Install Dependencies**

```sh
pip install pynput
```


## 🚀 Usage

```sh
python Simple_Keylogger.py
```
This will start the keylogger, and it will log keystrokes into `keylog.txt`.

### Stopping the Keylogger  
- Press **Esc** to manually stop logging.
